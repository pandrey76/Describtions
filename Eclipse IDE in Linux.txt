Install Eclipse on Ubuntu

1. Eclipse IDE requires Java JRE as a prerequisite. Therefore, our first step is to install
default-jre package. To do so run the bellow command:

    $ sudo apt install default-jre


2. Download the 64-bit Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers package

Navigate to the official Eclipse website and download the 64-bit Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers package.
Extract the Eclipse package downloaded in the previous step. Here we assume that the package has been downloaded into the Downloads directory.

   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2/eclipse-ide-cc-developers

3. Extract the package into the "/opt" directory:

    $ sudo tar xf eclipse-cpp-2019-12-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz -C /opt

4. Once the package has been extracted create a symbolic link to the /opt/eclipse/eclipse executable binary:

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/

5. From now on you should be able to start the Eclipse IDE simply by execution of the bellow command:

    $ eclipse

6. Create Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers desktop launcher. As an administrator create a new file called /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop using any text editor eg. nano:

    $ sudo nano /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop

Insert the following code:

[Desktop Entry]
Version = 2020â€‘06
Type = Application
Terminal = false
Name = Eclipse C/C++
Exec = /usr/local/bin/eclipse
Icon = /opt/eclipse/icon.xpm
Categories = Application;
